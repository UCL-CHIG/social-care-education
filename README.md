These scripts were developed for my PhD into non-enrolment and exclusion from school among children with social workers, available here: https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10140601/. These scripts also underpin the following publications:

- Jay MA, Mc Grath-Lone L, De Stavola B, Gilbert R. Risk of school exclusion among adolescents receiving social care or special educational needs services: a whole-population administrative data cohort study. Child Abuse & Neglect 2023;144:106325. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213423003137
- Jay MA, Mc Grath-Lone L, De Stavola B, Gilbert R. Evaluation of pushing out of children from all English state schools: administrative data cohort study of children receiving social care and their peers. Child Abuse & Neglect 2022;127:105582. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213422001028

The scripts were written over the three years of doctoral study and may not be well annotated. Any questions should be directed to me at the above address. Also includes code for new analyses run to carry out post-viva corrections.

Cleared for publication by ONS, STATS17943.
